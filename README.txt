Groodle Members,

In order to download and install the Angular framework to build the front end, do the following:

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ to download Visual Studio Code to develop the web-app.  
	It can handle ng (Angular) and npm (Node Package Manager) commands.
2. Go to https://angular.io/guide/quickstart .
3. Click on Node.jsÂ® and npm to download the Javascript run-time environment.
4. Click on the Angular CLI link to download the global CLI.
5. If you wish to create a new app, then you would open the Integrated Terminal in VSC 
	and enter: ng new NameOfWebAppHere
6. If you wish to server the app, then cd into the folder NameOfWebAppHere and enter:
	ng serve --open  (The --open will automatically open the webapp in your browser on 
	http://localhost:4200 .)
7. In the future, if you wish to work on a version of our Groodle project that one of us submits
	to Gitlab, then you will download the web-app folder onto your machine, cd into it, and then
	run the above commands in your VSC integrated terminal.  (You do not have to use VSC.  It is
	simply the on IDE that I am using that is compatible with Angular.  Apparently, there are others.)
